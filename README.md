# TimeMixer-KAN

### TimeMixer-KAN is an innovative model that combines the TimeMixer architecture with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance time series forecasting, particularly for stock trading. This model, even without fine-tuning, has demonstrated superior performance over the standard TimeMixer model in short-term stock price forecasting.

## Overview
TimeMixer-KAN is designed to leverage the strengths of both TimeMixer and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to process sequential data. By integrating these models, TimeMixer-KAN can effectively handle complex patterns in time series data, making it particularly useful for forecasting tasks in financial markets.

## Key Features
Hybrid Architecture: Combines TimeMixerâ€™s sequential modeling capabilities with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for increased flexibility and performance.

Superior Performance: Outperforms the standalone TimeMixer model in short-term forecasting tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy for stock trading.

## Usage
### Training
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python ./stocks.py --m3 --train --save_path ./timemixer_kan/
```
### Testing
To test the model, use:
```bash
python ./stocks.py --m3 --test --save_path ./timemixer_kan/
```

### Contributing
This is a small experiment project, and any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated! Feel free to comment, open issues, or submit pull requests to help improve the model and its capabilities. I am using both the TimeMixer model concept (https://github.com/kwuking/TimeMixer) and KAN (https://github.com/pg2455/KAN-Tutorial)
