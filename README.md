# TimeMixer-KAN

### TimeMixer-KAN is an innovative model that combines the TimeMixer architecture with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance time series forecasting, particularly for stock trading. This model, even without fine-tuning, has demonstrated superior performance over the standard TimeMixer model in short-term stock price forecasting.

# Overview
TimeMixer-KAN is designed to leverage the strengths of both TimeMixer and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to process sequential data. By integrating these models, TimeMixer-KAN can effectively handle complex patterns in time series data, making it particularly useful for forecasting tasks in financial markets.

## Key Features
Hybrid Architecture: Combines TimeMixerâ€™s sequential modeling capabilities with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for increased flexibility and performance.

Superior Performance: Outperforms the standalone TimeMixer model in short-term forecasting tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy for stock trading.
